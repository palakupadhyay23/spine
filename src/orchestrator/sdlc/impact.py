"""Blast-radius + reference checks for the design stage — grounded, no LLM.

The design stage decides *what to build*; this module grounds two further
questions against the Product Knowledge Graph, deterministically:

* **Blast radius** — for each module a design says it will touch, who imports it
  (module-level dependents) and which of its symbols have the most callers
  (the risky-to-change hotspots). This is the "what does changing X touch?"
  the graph already answers (``FactStore.importers_of`` / ``callers_of`` /
  ``impact_of``), moved *before* code is written rather than caught in review.
* **Unverified references** — modules a design names that don't exist in the
  graph, so a hallucinated path is flagged for confirmation instead of silently
  scaffolded. Suppressed on an ungrounded (greenfield) repo, where "absent" is
  expected of everything.

Module-level impact works for every front-end that emits ``IMPORTS`` (all of
them); symbol-level hotspots need ``CALLS`` (absent for TypeScript/Java today),
so their absence is reported honestly rather than implied to be zero impact.
