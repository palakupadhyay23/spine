"""Android specifics for Kotlin codegen — P9, D13 of ``docs/specs/kotlin-support-roadmap.md``.

An Android repository *is* a Kotlin repository, and P8 already reads it correctly:
``detect_kotlin_layout`` searches ``src/main/java`` precisely because Android keeps Kotlin
in the Java source root. Two things are still different, and each decides whether generated
code compiles at all.

**Sources live in Gradle submodules, never at the repository root.** The validation app is
28 modules and has no ``src/`` at its root, so the single-module placement P8 ships resolves
to a directory that belongs to no Gradle project: the file would be written, compiled by
nothing, and verified by a task that does not exist. Placement therefore chooses the module
*first*, keyed on the target package — the one piece of information that actually says where
a change belongs.

**The unit-test task is per-variant.** The Android Gradle Plugin compiles a library once per
build variant, so its JVM unit tests run as ``testDebugUnitTest``. A plain Kotlin/JVM module
in the same build — ``:core:model`` is one — still uses ``test``, so the task is a property
of the *module*, not of the repository, and a build that mixes both needs both spellings.

Instrumented tests (``connectedAndroidTest``, ``src/androidTest/``) are out of scope by
decision rather than omission: they need a device or an emulator (§10). A generated screen
gets a JVM-testable slice and the UI test is stated as an explicit TODO — said, not hidden.
