"""Areas — the coarse component grouping, shared by `state` and the episteme.

An **area** is a component one zoom level above a module: the first two segments of a
module's path or dotted namespace (``src/smf/smf-sm.c`` → ``src/smf``; ``App.Api.Users``
→ ``App.Api``). A **zone** is one level coarser still — the first segment (``src``,
``App``).

This lives in one place on purpose. ``state``'s architecture flowchart and the episteme's
area pages both group by area, and if they each derived it their own way they would show
different architectures for the same commit — and a reader who noticed would stop trusting
both. One definition, two renderers.

The subtle rule, learned the hard way (see ``AreaIndex.area_of``): a node's area comes from
the module it *lives in*, resolved by walking CONTAINS upward — never from its bare symbol
id.

#: How much of a project's dotted modules a prefix must cover before it counts as an
#: organisational prefix rather than architecture. Measured rather than picked: on the
#: Android validation app the vendor prefix `com.google.samples.apps.nowinandroid` covers
#: **94.4%** of first-party modules and the very next segment drops to **57.7%** — that
#: cliff is where the namespace stops naming the organisation and starts naming components.
#: On this repository the deepest majority prefix is `orchestrator` at **48.1%**, so the
#: rule is a no-op here, which is the point: `orchestrator.pkg` already *is* the area.
#:
#: The threshold sits in that measured gap rather than at its top edge, because the fraction
#: is sensitive to how many modules there are: one dissenting module out of six is 17%, and a
#: rule tuned to a 71-module repository would refuse to fire on a small one for the same
#: single outlier.
